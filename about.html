  <p>Giant pandas are identified by their distinctive black and white coloring. 
    Their ears, muzzle, eyes, shoulders and legs are black while the rest of their body is white. 
    Their thick hair keeps them warm in the cool, wet mountain zones. When on all fours, giant pandas average between 60-100 cm (2-3 ft.) 
    tall at the shoulder and between 1-2 m (4-6 ft.) long. 
    They can weigh between 100-115 kg (220-250 lb.), with males being larger than females.

  <p>Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo shoots and leaves. Occasionally they eat other vegetation, fish, or small animals, 
    but bamboo accounts for 99 percent of their diets. Pandas eat fast, they eat a lot, and they spend 
    about 12 hours a day doing it. The reason: They digest only about a fifth of what they eat. Overall, bamboo is 
    not very nutritious. To stay healthy, they have to eat a lot—up to 15 percent of their body weight in 12 hours—so they
    eat fast.<br> (nationalgeographic) </p>
